                    <dd>Voice-Enabled Interfaces: As voice search becomes more prevalent with devices like smart speakers, web developers will need to optimize websites for voice search and create conversational interfaces.
                    </dd><dd>    Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: These will become more sophisticated, offering real-time customer support and interactive experiences directly within websites.</dd>
